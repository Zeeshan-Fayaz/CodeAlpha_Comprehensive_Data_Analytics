Amazon Product Data Projects
This repository contains three major Python data projects based on real-world Amazon product data.
The workflow demonstrates the complete process from data collection (via web scraping) to exploration and visualization, showing strong data analytics and Python programming skills.

Projects Included

Cleaned and stored the data in CSV format (amazon.csv).
Libraries Used:
requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, time, random
Output File: amazon.csv
Key Skills:
Data extraction, HTML parsing, error handling, structured data saving.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Goal: Understand and analyze the scraped Amazon dataset.
Tasks Performed:
Data cleaning — handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting columns to numeric types.
Statistical summaries and correlation analysis.
Category-wise product insights.
Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
Key Insights:
Most common rating range: 4.0–4.5
Electronics and Home & Kitchen have the most listings.
Price variation is significant across categories.
Output File: amazon_cleaned.csv 

3️⃣ Data Visualization

Goal: Create clear, meaningful visualizations of the dataset
Visuals Created:
Distribution of Ratings
Price Distribution for Top 6 Categories
Top 10 Products by Number of Reviews

Libraries Used:
matplotlib, seaborn, pandas
Skills Demonstrated:
Visualization design and aesthetics.
Use of histograms, bar charts, and boxplots.
Seaborn styling and custom layout management.
